## Description of the project:
In this project tracked all buses for a specific route.
## How to Run: 
Enter a valid route number in the text field and click find bus button. All the available busses in that route will be displayed with bus number, from-to, and seat information. We can see the latest information for every 15 sec. Can close the popups if needed. Alert message comes when no busses available in the entered route.
Note: We need to get api token for both mapbox and MBTA bus data apis.

## Roadmap of future improvements:
Add a red blink for buses which stopped at a bus station. Find which bus is closer to the user.
